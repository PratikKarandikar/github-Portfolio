This is the basic version of the Digital Clock which shows 12 hour formatting.
I have used black background to show time, and with it we can use lime green 
or aqua colors for text and number formatting which shines out and create neon themes vibe.
Just copy or download the code and paste it into the console and you will get cool looking digital clock.
